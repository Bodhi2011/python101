- In order to add or remove a number you must follow the simple format of **row/column/number**. If I wanted to add two at row two and column two, I'd input 222. So simple! If I'd want to remove a number, the last number should be 0. If I wanted to remove the number at row two column six, I'd input 460. The zero meaning remove! You can quit by type **000**. You'll be given the correct solution if you couldn't solve it.

### Rules of Sudoku
> Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square in order to **win**. 

#### FAQ
1. If you add a number to invalidate the sudoku then it will reverse what you've done.
2. If you remove a number that was in the correct spot, it will reverse what you've done.

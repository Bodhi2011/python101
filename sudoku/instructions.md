# Instructions on how to play Sudoku

## How to Play
In order to start the puzzle you are to download the file and unzip it. You then have to make sure you're in the same directory as the sudoku folder. Then type ./sudoku/sudoku.py
If it doesn't work, I would suggest learning about directories and file paths and making sure the folder is in the same directory as you.
This will execute the file starting the game!

- In order to add or remove a number you must follow the simple format of **row/column/number**. If I wanted to add two at row two and column two, I'd input 222. So simple! If I'd want to remove a number, the last number should be 0. If I wanted to remove the number at row two column six, I'd input 460. The zero meaning remove! You can quit by type **000**. You'll be given the correct solution if you couldn't solve it.

#### FAQ
